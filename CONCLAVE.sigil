// MANDATORY: Before starting any task, agents MUST:
// 1. Read this file to understand schema and existing sessions
// 2. Add their entry in CURRENT SESSIONS
// 3. Update progress throughout the session
// 4. Update anima honestly when state changes
// 5. Move entry to archive and add reflection when done
